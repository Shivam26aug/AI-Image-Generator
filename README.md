# AI-Image-Generator
The AI Image Generator is a web-based application that allows users to generate images using AI. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project uses the Axios library to fetch AI-generated images from an API. Users can input a description or select specific parameters, and the AI processes the request to generate a matching image.
